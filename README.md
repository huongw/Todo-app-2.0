# Taskana (To-do App)

## Description
I created this app using Vanilla JS to better understand the fundamentals of coding and to learn the IIFE design pattern.

## Tech Stacks
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Functionality
- This to-do app will allow the user to **submit**, **edit**, **save**, **cancel**, and **delete** a task.
- When user leaves/refreshes the page, tasks will remain as it was using local storage.
- User will be able to submit a task with a due date (or without) which will then count down at **23:59:59** each day from the current date up to the final due date.
- When user completes a task, the chibi will express compliments to encourage and show gratitude for finishing a task.
- User can filter tasks that are **complete**, **incomplete**, and **all** tasks using the drop down filter.
- Tasks will append to the list in the order of the due dates. Upcoming due dates will appear at the top while null dates will appear at the very end.
